There was a focus last week on Qantas fleet's age, after its impressive profit result was announced. The article [Qantas' maturing fleet](http://rpubs.com/steve_g/368567) compares the Qantas and Jetstar fleets to the other top twenty airlines in terms of international passengers carried, to and from Australia. In addition, the main U.S. carriers are compared, to get a wider context.
