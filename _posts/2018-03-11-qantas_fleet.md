title: Qantas' fleet
---

There was a focus recently on the Qantas fleet's age, after its impressive profit result was announced in late February. The article [Qantas' maturing fleet](http://rpubs.com/steve_g/368567) compares the Qantas and Jetstar fleets' ages, against the other major regional international airlines. In addition, the main U.S. carriers are compared, to get a wider context.

* Jetstar began commercial operations as a domestic low-cost carrier in 2004.
* The airline was started as a low fares offshoot of Qantas, which was founded in Queensland, Australia in 1920.
* Qantas was first listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1995. The company now has a fleet of 123 in the Qantas flagship fleet, while Jetstar's Australian fleet numbers 71 (according to airlfleets.com as at 12 March 2018).
